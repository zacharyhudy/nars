			<h2>North American Rail Safety</h2>
			<p>is a Company comprised of 3 individuals from Yorkton/Melville area.  We are all family men with interests in the outdoors, motocross and snowmobiling.  Between raising our families and working in a safety sensitive environment for many years, we understand how important safety is.</p>
			<p>We decided to do this together so we could pass on our interests in railroading, the importance of safety and what it takes to go home to our families at night.</p>
